    "# Strategy Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "The Strategy pattern proposes a way of handling multiple solutions or algorithms to do something. \n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, there are multiple ways of doing something. If you don't use Strategy, you may end up having a big block of code full of 'if-else' statements for every possible solution. If there are not many algorithms and there won't be more in a future, some 'if-else' statements are admissible. However, sometimes it is not the case or you cannot foresee. This is where Strategy makes sense. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using Strategy, every algorithm is encapsulated in a class and you can easily change from one to another at runtime, depending on your needs. All these classes inherit from the same abstract base class or implement the same interface. By doing that, you guarantee that you'll be able to use these classes in a polymorphic way, that is, the client code won't care about the strategy it has to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "What's more, if you want to add a new strategy eventually, you'll just have to create a new class derived from the base strategy class and the client code will be able to use it without any changes. This provides unlimited flexibility."
