    "# The Decorator Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern allows you to attach additional responsibilities to an object at runtime without modifying it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, to add new functionalities to our system we end up implementing an unnecessary, complex class hierarchy that leads to the 'class explosion' problem. For example, in the context of a videogame, we can have a base enemy class, but we also want to be able to add extras to it such as helmets or armors. If we define one class for each possible combination, we will end up getting too many classes: one for the BaseEnemy, and some more for the BaseEnemyWithHelmet, BaseEnemyWithArmor and BaseEnemyWithArmorAndHelmet. That's too many classes! And, of course, if we want to add a new extra such as gloves, we will have to create even more classes. This is a case of 'class explosion' and it's not the better way to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Decorator Pattern can help us with this. But first, let's define the terminology:\n",
    "- **Component Interface**: An interface for the base objects.\n",
    "- **Component**: The object that may be decorated. In the previous example, this would be the 'EnemyBase' class. Every *Component* of the system implements the *Component Interface*.\n",
    "- **Decorator**: The extras that will be added to the base *Component* We will have one *Decorator* for each 'extra'. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using this pattern, we can add all the *Decorators* that we want to our base *Component*. It doesn't matter if we want to add just one *Decorator* or multiple of them: the pattern works for any number. It means that we can decorate the base class or decorated classes too. It's like an onion: we can add all the layers that we want. But keep in mind that sometimes the order of these layers does matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a base *Component* and a decorated *Component*, you should be able to use them interchangeably. So, the *Decorator* classes must inherit from the *Component* class too, so *Decorator* **is a** *Component* as well. Simultaneously, the *Decorator* class must **have a** *Component* inside it - that is, a composition. In the previous example, we could have an *armor Decorator* that has a *helmet Decorator* that has the *base enemy Component*. This recursive architecture is the thing that allows the decorator pattern to be implemented. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note as well that all the messages received by the most superficial *Decorator* can be transferred over the layers to reach the base *Component*; Those layers can modify that message too, or add new behaviours.\n",
