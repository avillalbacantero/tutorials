    "# Composite Pattern\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The Composite Pattern helps you to create, organizate and manage a entities composed by several different parts. Similarly, each one of these parts might be composed by another parts, and so on, creating a tree hierarchy.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Using this pattern, you'll have a parent base class and its childs. For example, you can have a Enemy class as the parent and different kind of arms, legs or bodies composing it as the childs. However:\r\n",
    "- When you create your parent class, you don't want to be creating all of its childs too. That would be even more complex if you have many parent instances created in your client code.\r\n",
    "- When you take some action on the parent class, you don't want to be calling the same action in all of its childs. For example, if you make your Enemy move you shouldn't have to make every arm or leg move too. That would be unnecessarly complex, especially if there are many childs.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "To create that level of abstraction in which the main code or the client only uses the parent class without knowning how it is composed by or how it executes its tasks, you must have an abstract base class from which the parent as well as all of its childs are derived and the parent will have its childs as attributes or properties. This kind of design enables to change the childs' behaviour depending on the state of the parent too.  \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Terminology:\r\n",
    "- Composite: The parent class\r\n",
    "- Leaf: One child class\r\n",
    "- Component: The abstract base class from which the Composite and all the Leafs are derived.\r\n",
