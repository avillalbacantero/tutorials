    "# Abstract Factory pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "As its name suggests, the Abstract Factory pattern is related to the Factory Method. \n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract Factory is a group of Factories, where each Factory Method is responsible for generating a different kind of object. Because of that, Abstract Factory offers the same benefits as Factory:\n",
    "- It makes tracking objects creation easier.\n",
    "- It deacouples object creation from its usage, providing a layer of abstraction.\n",
    "- It improves memory usage and performance of our app.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, **how do we choose between Factory and Abstract Factory?** Basically:\n",
    "- If a Factory is needed in our app, we usually start using different Factory Methods. If we find out that we need many Factory Methods and that there are some objects logically related to others, we will combine their factory methods to create a unique method that returns a family of objects instead of a single object instance.\n",
    "- If we need to prevent that two objects coexist at the same time, that is, they are mutually exclusive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see it with an example: imagine that you have a graphic interface with two types of customization: the classic theme and the modern theme. If you want to create elements that follow the classic theme, you shouldn't be able to create elements from the modern theme at the same time. What's more, you won't like to be creating one object at a time, such as buttons, bars, menus and so on: you'd prefer to call a method which internally manages all this logic and just returns all these elements. That's where Abstract Factory makes sense. \n",
