    "# Factory Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The Factory Method is a **Creational Design Pattern** which aims to encapsulate the creation of objects and to facilitate its reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this design pattern, instead of directly instanciating a class, the main code asks to a factory function for an object without knowning *how* it is created or from *where*; It does not care about the class that generates it nor about how it is implemented. \n",
    "\n",
    "But... **WHEN** should we use the Factory Method instead of direct class instanciation?\n",
    "- If you cannot track easily all the objects created in your app because **the code that creates them is in many different places**, you should consider this design pattern. The Factory Method **centralizes** object creation so that any change you would like to do in the way objects are created would have to be modified **only once**: in the factory method. \n",
    "- If you want to **decouple object creation from its usage** so that adding new objects or modifying the way of creating them would only affect to the creation part, not to the code which uses them. \n",
    "- If you don't know all the possible objects you have to generate at a time, or your app is open up to new object types in the future.\n",
    "- In addition, the Factory Method shows better performance and memory usage than using direct class instantiation. So you should consider it if you are working with large objects and you want to minimize resources usage and keep your app efficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Factory Method has some advantages as well as disadvantages. The main advantages are:\n",
    "- You decople object creation from its concrete implementations.\n",
    "- It's easier to satisfy the Single Reponsibility Principle (SRP) (SOLID).\n",
    "- It's easier to satisfy the Open Closed Principle (OCP) (SOLID).\n",
    "\n",
    "However:\n",
    "- The code becomes more complex and you will have to create new multiple subclasses. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Factory Method we have four maining classes:\n",
    "- First, we have a *Creator* class. This is an abstract class and the parent of all the factories used in the system. At least, it has one method called the *factoryMethod()* which is the responsible of creating and returning new objects. Often, these objects are called *Products*. Optionally, the *factoryMethod()* can receive some parameters.\n",
    "- From the *Creator* class, we inherit all the *ConcreteCrator* classes, whose aim is to create new *ConcreteProducts*. Each *ConcreteCreator* overrides and implements the *factoryMethod()* derived from the *Creator* class. In other words, *Creator* classes are the factories of our products.\n",
    "- On the other side, we have a *Product* abstract class, which is the base class for all the existing concrete products on our app.\n",
    "- Finally, we have one or more *ConcreteProduct* classes, which are classes derived from *Product* that represent specific products on our app. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to these parts, it's completely OK to have multiple factories methods. Each factory method logically groups the creation of objects that have some similarities. \n",
    "\n",

    "We are going to develop a parser that reads input files with multiple formats such as XML and JSON. \n",

    "We are going to use the Factory Method to create the connectors or readers of each file format. For example, we are going to have one class to read XML ('XMLConnector') and another one to read JSON ('JSONConnector'). These are the *ConcreteProducts* of the pattern. We will also have another abstract class called 'Connector' that defines a property called 'parsed_data()'. 'Connector' is the so-called *Product* class of the pattern. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we will have a 'ConnectionFactory', which is the *Creator* of the pattern, that defines a factory method called 'create_connection()' that returns a 'Connector', that is, a *Product*. From 'ConnectionFactory', we will inherit a class called 'ConcreteConnectionFactory' that implements the 'create_connection()' method and returns specific types of connections, such as 'XLMConnector' or 'JSONConnector', that is, *ConcreteProduct*s.\n",
